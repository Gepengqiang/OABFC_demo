# An optimized additive bias field correction model for infrared image segmentation with intensity non-uniformity

## Abstract
Infrared (IR) images are often affected by the bias field effects, leading to the phenomenon of intensity non-uniformity. This phenomenon can severely degrade image contrast and obscure fine details. In addition, excessive convolution operations are involved to extract features during level set evolution (LSE), which results in long segmentation time. Moreover, the energy functions of most existing ACMs are constructed based solely on either local or global intensity information, which may cause edge leakage or local minima trapping while IR images with intensity non-uniformity. To address these issues, an optimized additive bias field correction (OABFC) model for infrared image segmentation with intensity non-uniformity is proposed. First and foremost, the global true image is estimated using the Gaussian mixture model with K-means++ initialization prior to LSE, which greatly reduces convolution number and CPU runtime during evolution. Based on the additive image model, the local data-driven term provides consistent bias field correction during LSE to enhance image contrast between foreground and background regions, which mitigates the side effect of intensity non-uniformity and improves segmentation precision. Furthermore, a global data-driven term is constructed based on global intensity mean, adaptively combined with the local data-driven term through an adaptive weight function. As a result, this combination generates a hybrid data-driven term, whose unstable range is regularized through non-linear stretching. During LSE, the level set function (LSF) keeps its signed distance function (SDF) to achieve a stable numerical solution through regularization. Meanwhile, the mean filtering technique maintains its smoothness and eliminates unwanted background noise. Eventually, the LSE converges to generate zero level set once the convergence criteria are satisfied. Compared with recently developed ACMs, our OABFC model generates superior segmentation precision (Jaccard Similarity Coefficient (JSC), Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC), and Mean Hausdorff Distance (MHD)) on average. In addition, it exhibits better bias field correction (BFC) performance on IR images with intensity non-uniformity and shows potential for generalization to the Breast Ultrasound Images (BUSI) dataset.
